## Overview  

PopClip for Mac is a clever text utility that makes text manipulation faster and more natural on macOS. When you highlight any text, PopClip instantly appears beside your selection, offering one-click access to essential actions like copy, paste, search, and define. This makes everyday text operations smoother and much more intuitive — eliminating unnecessary keyboard shortcuts or extra mouse movements.  

Unlike traditional clipboard tools, PopClip focuses on real-time usability. Its elegant, iOS-inspired pop-up design fits seamlessly into the macOS interface, maintaining a minimal look while offering powerful capabilities. Whether you’re a writer editing documents, a developer copying snippets, or a student organizing notes, PopClip helps reduce friction and saves valuable time.  

The true power of PopClip lies in its customization options. It supports hundreds of community extensions that connect to various services — from note apps to browsers, email clients, and automation tools. You can quickly add shortcuts for things like sending text to Google Translate, saving links to Pocket, or running scripts. The ability to craft your own extensions means PopClip can adapt perfectly to any personal or professional workflow.  

With full support for modern macOS versions and Apple Silicon, PopClip offers exceptional performance and reliability. It’s small, efficient, and constantly updated to match macOS improvements. If you value workflow efficiency, PopClip is one of the best utilities you can add to your setup.
